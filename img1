AWS is flexible in their approach to certifications, so you’re able to pursue the certification exam you feel is most appropriately matched to your skills, professional experience, and interests.
The majority of certifications are currently intended for SRE/Architects, Developers, and Ops/SysAdmins.
Here is the entire chart of AWS Certifications:
The Foundational (AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner) level is intended for individuals who are looking to build and validate overall understanding of the AWS Cloud. It’s useful for individuals in technical, managerial, sales, purchasing, or financial roles who work on AWS.
At the Associate level, there are three certifications:
AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (for Solutions Architects)
AWS Certified Developer – Associate (for Software Developers)
AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate (for Systems Administrators in a Systems Operations role)
Before I dive into the Professional level later on in this post, it’s important to mention that at the end of 2018, AWS Certification announced that customers now have the option to attempt any exam at any time, regardless of level or type.
AWS Certification offers three Specialty certifications:
AWS Certified Advanced Networking – Specialty (for individuals who perform complex networking tasks)
AWS Certified Big Data – Specialty (for Big Data professionals)
AWS Certified Security – Specialty (for Security professionals)
Companies are becoming more and more interested in getting as many employees trained and certified so they can build customer confidence. AWS Certifications prove a company’s expertise in using AWS and open doors to a partnership with AWS as a service provider in the APN.
